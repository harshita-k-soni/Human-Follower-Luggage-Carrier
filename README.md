# Human-Follower-Luggage-Carrier
Navigating through train stations with heavy luggage can be challenging, often resulting in discomfort and fatigue. To address this issue, we developed a prototype of a human-following luggage carrier. This device incorporates ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, Arduino microcontroller, and DC motors to facilitate its functionalities.
