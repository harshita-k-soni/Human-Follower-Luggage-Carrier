# Human-Follower-Luggage-Carrier
Navigating through train stations with heavy luggage can be challenging, often resulting in discomfort and fatigue. To address this issue, we developed a prototype of a human-following luggage carrier. This device incorporates ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, Arduino microcontroller, and DC motors to facilitate its functionalities.
# Working Principle 
The working principle of the human-following luggage carrier prototype involves several components and sensors working together to enable autonomous movement and tracking of the user.

1. Ultrasonic Sensors: These sensors emit high-frequency sound waves and measure the time taken for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. They detect obstacles in the carrier's path, ensuring safe navigation.

2. IR Sensors: Infrared sensors emit infrared light and measure the intensity of the reflected light. They detect the presence of a human user, allowing the carrier to track their movements effectively.

3. Arduino Microcontroller: Acting as the brain of the carrier, the Arduino processes inputs from sensors and controls the movement of DC motors accordingly. It determines the direction and speed of movement required to follow the user while avoiding obstacles.

4. Motor Driver: Serving as an interface between the Arduino and DC motors, the motor driver regulates power and control signals to operate the motors effectively. It interprets commands from the Arduino and translates them into specific motor movements, allowing precise control over speed and direction.

5. DC Motors: These motors propel the carrier based on commands received from the Arduino via the motor driver. They adjust their speed and direction to track the user's movements while avoiding obstacles.

Through this coordinated effort, the human-following luggage carrier prototype can autonomously navigate train stations, alleviating the burden of carrying heavy luggage for travelers.
